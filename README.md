# Company Turnover Rate Analysis

## Satisfaction Ratings

When analyzing retention rates, a common way to gain insight is through customer satisfaction. The bar chart to the left displays the number of employees who have left and the number of employees who have stayed in comparison to their satisfaction rating. This shows us that employees who leave tend to have a satisfaction rating of < 0.5. Since there are a significant number of employees with higher than average satisfaction ratings that still left, this tells us that there must be other contributing factors to retention rate.

## Page 3: Evaluation Rating

Most employees that left had a most recent evaluation between 0.4 and 0.6. However, over 1500 employees with a rating over 0.8 still left the company. This suggests other features are likely more important when analyzing/predicting retention rates.

Here we see a scatterplot of all employees who have left the company. It's immediately apparent that the majority of employees who have left fall into one of three clusters:
- The top right cluster relates to employees with high satisfaction and high evaluation ratings.
- The top left relates to high performance but low satisfaction. This suggests that these employees left due to feeling undervalued or undercompensated.
- The bottom cluster relates to poor performance and low satisfaction. No further analysis needed for this cluster.

These histograms indicate the average working hours for both groups are around 200 hours. Most employees that departed worked an average of 100-150 hours per month, indicating that part-time employees have a higher turnover rate. However, there was also a high turnover rate for workers working more than 250 hours. Workers most likely to remain in the company worked around 150-200 hours a month.

Most employees who leave have completed 3 years at the job. The majority of other employees who left, left after 4, 5, or 6 years. The lowest turnover rates are at <2 years and >6 years. Lower turnover rates at <2 years likely correlate with the employee seeking promotion at the company. It's likely that employees tend to leave after 3 years if they haven't received a promotion.

The most important numerical features when analyzing employee retention rate at this company are satisfaction level, average monthly hours, and promotion. Employees who leave on average have a lower satisfaction rating and work longer hours on average. Employees who achieve promotion are the employees least likely to leave the company.
